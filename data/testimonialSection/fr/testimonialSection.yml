  ## What Do People Say About Me?

    comment: Esther helped me a lot in finding accommodation in Rennes. Without her helps and follow-ups, I wasn’t able to find an apartment simply. Also since I couldn’t speak French well, she  helped me with some administrative works related to opening an electricity contract. I’m totally satisfied with this service          .

    comment: Soleil Company is a crossroads of responsibility, punctuality, and professionalism. From the first day, they have been with me step by step through this process and have clarified the way for me with their experiences. In short, this company will pick you from home and say goodbye at your place of residence in France.
